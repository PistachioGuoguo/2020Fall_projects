## Background



## Reference

1. the speed of villagers gathering resources, and training time, I referred to data from [Age of Empires 2 Fandom](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_\(Age_of_Empires_II\))

2. the idea of using a heap (priority queue) to accommodate and execute all the events one by one, I learned from [Prof. Tim Roughgarden](http://timroughgarden.org/)'s [Algorithm Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)
